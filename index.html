            </div>
        <div class="who">
            <p>I'm Charlotte! I've worked at Amazon for the past three years in a few different operational and retail roles. My work is often project management based, working on large-scale continuous improvement projects. I work as part of a pan-EU team and often need to work cross-functionally with tech teams, advertising, and marketing stakeholders. My role demands a high level of organization, an analytical mind-set and strong relationship and communication skills, especially with external partners.
            <br><br>
            In my spare time I've worked on a few different digital projects, including designing an app and creating this website. I've been upskilling on general digital marketing and recently graduated from Udacity's Digital Marketing Nanodegree. Check my portfolio out, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GTVEeyGMYL7DoxGTaG-9YFCtuYz61GWt/view?usp=sharing">here.</a> I'm always looking for ways to bring my love of digital media into my day to day work - I'm open for a chat if you think you have an opportunity!

        <div class="what">
            <p>I work as a Vendor Manager in fashion. That means I largely work on three things: 
                <ol>
                    <li>Project management: I manage EU-impacting Amazon Fashion projects. I'm currently working on a project to improve vendor and VM experience. As a PM I work cross-functionally with a number of different teams and use Agile methodology and regularly use Trello and Jira adjacent tools.</li>
                    <li>Performance management: I work with our vendors to create joint goals and action-plans, fostering accountability on both sides. This often involves working with departments across the organisation, including marketing and advertising and requires excellent stakeholder management with both internal departments and external vendors.</li>
                    <li>Buying: I make data driven decisions on what selection to buy, analysing what customers have bought before to predict what we should focus on in future.</li>
                    </ol>
